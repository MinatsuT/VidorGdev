= VidorTwoWire Arduino library

== Constructor

 VidorTwoWire(int _scl, int _sda)
	* creates the object and caches SCL and SDA pins

== Methods

 int begin()
 	* required the pins and initializes the IP core with default parameters (400KHz clock); must be called before performing any operation
	* returns -1 on failure (if IP core is not present or pins can't be assigned)

All other methods replicate Arduino Wire library. However, VidorTwoWire does not support operating as an I2C slave.
